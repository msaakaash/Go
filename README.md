## About
This repository contains implementations of fundamental Go concepts, including goroutines, channels, and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). The project is inspired by the **Distributed Systems** course from the 3rd year of **B.Tech CSE** at **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore**, taught by **Dr. Shanmuga Priya S**.

## Topics Covered
- **Go Basics**: Syntax, data types, control structures
- **Goroutines**: Concurrency in Go
- **Channels**: Communication between goroutines
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)**: Inter-process communication

## Prerequisites
- Install **Go**: [Download Here](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Knowledge of networking (for RPC implementations)

## Installation & Setup

   cd Go
   ```
2. Run the Go programs:
   ```sh
   go run filename.go
   ```

## Usage
- Navigate to different implementation files
- Modify and experiment with concurrency and RPC examples
- Use `go run` to execute specific Go programs
